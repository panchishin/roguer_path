combat system
	turn based means multiple attacks on 1 target and that 1 target has to choose how to respond
	interaction based means each attack automatically gets a counter attack

	gurps system : chance to hit, chance to parry (active/passive), armour points, hit locations, called shots etc
	rune quest system : chance to hit, chance to parry/block/dodge, armour points, hit pts per location, range
	talisiman system : contest of skill, few hitpoints, armour chance
	dnd system : contest of skill vs armour, many hitpoints, surges, special moves

	attack chance, attack damage, defence chance, defence damage
	chance to hit = attack chance - defence chance w/ random
	damage of hit = attack damage - defence damage w/ random

	example : basic 1/1/0/0 vs basic 1/1/0/0 -> to hit = 1-0+rand(-c,c)>0 , damage = 1-0+rand(-d,d)
	example : sword 2/4/1/0 vs chainmail 0/0/2/2 -> to hit = 1+2-2+rand(-c,c)>0 , damage = 1+4-2+rand(-d,d)
	example : basic 1/1/0/0 vs agile 3/1/2/0 -> to hit = 1-2 , damage = 1-0
